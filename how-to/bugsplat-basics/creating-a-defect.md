# Creating a Defect

Using BugSplat with your defect or issue tracker tool is a great way to improve your support workflow and stay organized.

BugSplat integrates with popular defect tracking tools and allows users to create defects with a single-button click. Hyperlinks allow quick navigation from defects to crash reports and back. Defects created from BugSplat automatically include symbolic call stack information as well as other crash-specific data.

Follow this [link](../../getting-started/integrating-with-tools/issue-trackers/) to learn more about integrating your defect tracker with BugSplat, as well as creating defects from individual crashes and stack keys,
