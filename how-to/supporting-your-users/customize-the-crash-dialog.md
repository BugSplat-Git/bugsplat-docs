# Add Custom Branding to the Crash Dialog

Both the Windows and Mac crash report dialogs can be customized. For Mac instructions see our [macOS](https://www.bugsplat.com/docs/sdk/os-x) guide.

On Windows we provide the BugSplatRc project as part of the Native and .NET downloads. This project is used to build the resource-only file BugSplatRc.dll.

When you update your dialog we would love it if you mention us somewhere in your crash dialog. These mentions really help us continue to grow and develop our company.

There is absolutely no requirement to give us a shoutout though – you’re free to make this crash dialog whatever you want it to be!

Check out our [Brand page](https://www.bugsplat.com/brand#crash-dialog) to see examples and inspiration on our dialogue box from our users.
