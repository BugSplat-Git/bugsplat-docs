# Why BugSplat?

Here's a list of the top reasons our users choose BugSplat.  If you agree, consider signing up [here](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/sign-up).

1. BugSplat provides our users with world-class crash reporting on [cross-platform](../introduction/getting-started/integrations/cross-platform/), [desktop](../introduction/getting-started/integrations/desktop/), [web](../introduction/getting-started/integrations/web/), [gaming](../introduction/getting-started/integrations/game-development/), and [mobile](../introduction/getting-started/integrations/mobile/) platforms.  
2. Getting up and running with a new account is easy and straightforward.  The process is well documented [here](../introduction/getting-started/) and our team provides responsive and friendly support along the way. 
3. BugSplat has years of experience \(15+ years to be precise\) providing crash reporting in a huge variety of applications - from individual developers with a side hustle all the way to Fortune 500's with millions of users.
4. We prioritize the features our users care about - from our no-nonsense, fast, and easy-to-navigate UI, to our insanely powerful search, we go above and beyond to build the features you ask for.
   1. Note: we take product feedback really seriously, any feature request we receive to the [Feedback](../education/untitled-1/sending-feedback.md) tool is seen by our team and discussed internally.  Most are responded to directly.
5. Once a user signs up with us they stay with BugSplat for an average of 5+ years.  This track record comes from us providing exceptional support and listening to what our users need.
6. Easy-to-understand and [fair pricing](../administration/plans-and-pricing-1/billing-and-plan-managment/).  With our pricing, there is nothing complicated - no big, scary, complex tables that leave you wondering what you're actually getting with a plan.  We prioritize simple.  In so doing, we've found lots of ways to pass along savings to our users.
7. BugSplat is a [bootstrapped company](who-is-bugsplat/) that answers only to our users - not some corporate overlords or a VC fund.  
8. Every new account signing up for BugSplat helps us [plant more trees](who-is-bugsplat/charitable-giving.md) to fight deforestation and the climate crisis through our partner One Tree Planted.
