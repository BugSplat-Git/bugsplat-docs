# Why BugSplat?

Here's a list of the top reasons our users choose BugSplat.  If you agree, consider signing up [here](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/sign-up).

1. BugSplat provides our users with world-class crash reporting on [cross-platform](../introduction/getting-started/integrations/cross-platform/), [desktop](../introduction/getting-started/integrations/desktop/), [web](../introduction/getting-started/integrations/web/), [gaming](../introduction/getting-started/integrations/game-development/), and [mobile](../introduction/getting-started/integrations/mobile/) platforms.  
2. Getting up and running with a new account is easy and straightforward.  The process is well documented [here](../introduction/getting-started/), and our team provides responsive, friendly support along the way.  
3. BugSplat has years of experience \(15+ years to be precise\) providing crash reporting in a huge variety of applications—from hustling, individual developers all the way to Fortune 500s with millions of users.
4. We prioritize the features our users care about. With a no-nonsense, fast, easy-to-navigate UI and insanely powerful search features, we go above and beyond to build the features you ask for.
   1. Note: we take product feedback really seriously, any feature request we receive to the [Feedback](../education/untitled-1/sending-feedback.md) tool is seen by our team and discussed internally.  Most are responded to directly.
5. Once a user signs up with us, they stay with BugSplat for more than 5 years on average. This track record comes from us providing exceptional support and listening to what our users need. 
6. With our simple, fair pricing, there is nothing complicated—no big, scary, complex tables that leave you wondering what you're actually getting with a plan. We prioritize the plain. In so doing, we've found lots of ways to pass along savings to our users. 
7. BugSplat is a [bootstrapped company](who-is-bugsplat/)that answers only to our users. We have no corporate overlords or  VC fund.  
8. Every new account signing up for BugSplat helps us [plant more trees](who-is-bugsplat/charitable-giving.md) to fight deforestation and the climate crisis through our partner, One Tree Planted.
