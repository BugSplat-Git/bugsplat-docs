# Who is BugSplat?

BugSplat started in 2004 as an informal side project by David Plunkett and a couple of friends.

Dave and the gang had built and maintained crash reporting tools at much larger software companies in their previous roles.  

This experience led them to three big takeaways: 

1. Crash reporting was a nearly magical tool for finding and fixing crash defects.  
2. Software is better and more stable with crash reporting - so everyone should use it.
3. Building and supporting a crash reporter was a lot of work.

### Back in 2004, if you wanted a crash reporter, you had to build it. 

Unfortunately, at the time, there wasn't a self-service crash reporting tool available for teams. The only option was a tool from Microsoft, but that tool sent crashes \(and valuable crash data hidden within\) directly to Microsoft instead of giving you access. At this time you couldn't brand the Microsoft crash dialogue which would allow your users to know it was you interested in the stability of their application. The branding was only and distinctly Microsoft's.

Because Microsoft was the only option at the time, it meant that you had to build and maintain a crash reporter in-house if you wanted to get crash data on your own applications.

For larger companies - like the ones where Dave and the gang first really encounteres crash reporters - this wasn't an issue because they could afford to dedicate a team to building a crash reporter.  

However… what if you weren't a billion-dollar company? How could you dedicate six or eight people to doing this? 

At that point, as a veteran of several startups, Dave knew first hand that there were tons of developers out there on teams that didn't have infinite resources or spare time to build a crash reporter.  

Sensing market and developer need - the team started building and expanding on BugSplat in 2003. Spending nights and weekends dedicated to the development, they fell quickly into the heady experience of building something new, fun, and exciting.

Family and friends protest that they never saw them anymore. The gangs' shirked responsibilities. Parties and barbecue invites were ignored. 

In 2004 BugSplat was launched, with SketchUp becoming the first paying customer on day one, beginning the bootstrapped tradition we continue to this day.

### Over the years, BugSplat has grown a lot.

Since launching in 2004, we've grown BugSplat through the team's sweat equity and the investment and trust our users place in us.

We've seen the industry change quite a bit during that time without products expanding and changing to best aid developers obsessed with application performance fight crash causing defects in their applications. 

BugSplat helps developers track and fix over 500 million crashes on ~350 million computers, tablets, consoles, and phones every year. Our average customer stays with us for five years, and we continually get great reviews for excellent service.

Since 2004, we've never taken a dime from investors and have fully built BugSplat through bootstrapping. That means we only answer to our customers, allowing us to put them first always.

We're lean, profitable, growing, and paying ourselves \(and supporting our families\) through BugSplat.

We know that we have an amazing gig with BugSplat. It’s a lot of work, sure, but we work everyday on interesting problems with great partners for our incredible users. We’re a fully remote company that emphasizes flexibility, self-responsibility, and personal and professional exploration.

All of this is to say…
