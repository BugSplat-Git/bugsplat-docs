# Who is BugSplat?

### Our Story 

BugSplat started in 2004 as an informal side project by David Plunkett and a couple of friends.

Dave and the gang had built and maintained crash reporting tools at much larger software companies in their previous roles.  

This experience led them to three big takeaways: 

1. Crash reporting was a nearly magical tool for finding and fixing crash defects.  
2. Software is better and more stable with crash reporting—so everyone should use it.
3. Building and supporting a crash reporter was a lot of work.

### Back in 2004, if you wanted a crash reporter, you had to build it.

Back in the day, there wasn't a self-service crash reporting tool available on the open market. If you or your team wanted to buy a crash reporter your only option was a tool from Microsoft that - instead of collecting crash data and giving your access to that valuable knowledge - sent the crash data directly to Microsoft. To us that kind of missed the point - we need access to crash data in order to fix crashes and improve application stability. What good is a third-party getting that data?

This meant that, if you wanted access to application crash data you had to build and maintain a crash reporter in-house.

For larger companies, this wasn't an issue. Specifically, the company that Dave worked for could afford to throw a team of six developers full time at building and maintaining a crash reporter.   

What if you weren't a billion-dollar company? How could you dedicate six or eight people to doing this? 

The BugSplat founding team were veterans of software startups which meant that they had firsthand knowledge that there were tons of developers out there who weren’t part of organizations that could afford to build their own crash reporter.

And even if you could afford to build a crash reporter, why spend the time, energy, and resources scaling up a new tool for the first time? Wouldn’t it be better to use a market-tested tool supported by experts?

Sensing market and developer need—the team started building and expanding on the BugSplat project in 2003.

Nights and weekends were quickly dedicated to development as the team fell quickly into the heady experience of building something new, fun, and exciting.

In 2004, BugSplat was launched with our friends at Sketchup being our first customers.

### Over the years, BugSplat has grown significantly. 

After we launched in 2004, we've worked hard to grow BugSplat into the developer tool it is today. During that time, we’ve always tried to remember that we built BugSplat to help busy developers, obsessed with application performance, more easily fix and support their applications.

In the 15+ years we’ve been doing this, we have seen the industry change quite a bit.

Many companies have entered the market in that time - some were free options from tech giants, and others were VC-backed startups raising millions to try and do the same things as BugSplat.

Through it all we’ve maintained a laser focus on providing our users with the best possible data on application crashes, keeping our application easy to use, building the features important to our users, and providing excellent customer support.

Despite the industry pressure we’re still 100% self-funded and have never accepted outside investment. That means we only answer to you, our customer. We're lean, profitable, growing, and supporting ourselves and our families through this business.

Today BugSplat helps developers track and fix over 500 million crashes on around 350 million computers, tablets, consoles, and phones every year. Our average customer stays with us for five years, and we continually get great reviews for excellent service.

We also know that we have an amazing gig with BugSplat. It’s a lot of work, sure, but we work every day on interesting problems with great partners for our incredible users. We’re a fully remote company that emphasizes flexibility, self-responsibility, and personal and professional exploration.
