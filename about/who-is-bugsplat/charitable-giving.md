# Charitable Giving

## Pledging at least 1%

BugSplat has taken a pledge to give at least 1% of our annual profits to charitable causes close to our hearts through the [Pledge 1%](https://pledge1percent.org/) program.  

As we continue to grow and build our business we're constantly looking for more ways to give back.  Our goal is to expand past giving 1% of profits in the coming year \(2021/2022\) to also giving 1% of our employee's time to causes we care about.
