# Our Values

## Our Values

### Our customers are our investors

It sounds obvious, but we really pride ourselves on how we interact with our users. Everyone on the team handles support - full stop. We‚Äôve never lost track of the fact that, as a bootstrapped software business our customers are our biggest supporters. They‚Äôve put lots of trust in us to do the best job possible. We do our best to give back every time we interact with one of our users.

### Own a wide range of roles

Being a small team, we ask our team members to handle a wide range of roles. It‚Äôs a bit of a cliche at this point - but having people owning and understanding multiple facets of the product and business leads to a huge bump in innovation, engagement, and personal growth. We wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way.

### Everything is a big f\*&$ing deal

How often has a small development task run into unseen difficulties and taken two or three times the time and effort initially predicted? The answer: all the f&\(\*ing time. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre dedicated to doing less, better. We don‚Äôt want to get lost in the weeds trying to out-feature anyone. We build straightforward, useful, and powerful tools - not overly complicated ones.

### Brilliant work happens wherever

BugSplat has our headquartered in Boulder, CO where we onboard team members and host all-hands meetings. However, our team is fully remote and has been since the beginning. One of the greatest things about working on a computer for a living is the freedom it can provide people. We're trying to maximize that for people who join our team. The bottom line for us is that great work can happen anywhere.
