# LootLocker

We're excited to announce our partnership with our friends at [LootLocker](https://www.lootlocker.io/)!  This partnership will make finding, diagnosing, and fixing crashes and game bugs a more integral part of the development and post-release process in LootLocker.

[LootLocker](https://www.lootlocker.io/) is a tool that provides out-of-the-box game systems, backend services, and live ops tools to games regardless of genre, scope, engine, or platform. 

Through this partnership, crash data from BugSplat will be made available to LootLocker developers in the LootLocker app.  This will help LootLocker users more seamlessly find and understand common defects their players are experiencing in-game. 

Furthermore, players will also be able to submit bug reports themselves and be rewarded or compensated with in-game content for any issues they might have experienced or discovered.

In the future, BugSplat will be integrated direcetly into the LootLocker management console to provide even easier access to crash reports. Here's a sneak peek of how it will look \(together with an updated metrics menu\).

Weâ€™re thrilled to be partnering with LootLocker to bring our crash reporting tools to even more game developers so that they can focus on making great games.
