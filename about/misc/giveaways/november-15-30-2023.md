**Amendment to Giveaway Terms and Conditions - Post Winner Selection (BugSplat November 15-30, 2023 Giveaway)**

**Effective Date: January 16, 2024**

Due to logistical issues in delivering the original prize, a PlayStation 5, we are amending the prize fulfillment as follows:

1. **Prize Substitution**: Instead of a PlayStation 5, the selected winner will receive a gift card with a value equivalent to the retail price of a PlayStation 5, approximately $588.52 (USD). This gift card is specifically intended for the purchase of a PlayStation 5 at a retailer of the winner's choice, subject to our approval.
2. **Notification and Consent**: The winner has been informed of this change. Consent for accepting the gift card as a substitute prize is required.
3. **Legal Compliance**: This amendment complies with applicable laws and regulations.
4. **Acceptance of Terms**: The winner's acceptance of the substituted prize constitutes agreement to these amended terms.
5. **Liability**: The organizers are not liable for the initial inability to deliver the PlayStation 5.

This amendment is made on **January 16, 2024**, and is effective immediately. By accepting the substituted prize, the winner agrees to the terms outlined above.

All other terms and conditions of the BugSplat November 15-30, 2023 Giveaway remain unchanged and in effect.
