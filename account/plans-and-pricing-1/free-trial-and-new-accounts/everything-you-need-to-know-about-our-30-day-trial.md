# Everything you need to know about our 15-day trial

Just [sign up](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/sign-up) for an account and start using BugSplat as a regular user.

For the first 30-days you’ll have full access to BugSplat’s crash reporting tool. No credit card is required to sign up for an account.

When the 30-day trial expires, you’ll be asked to upgrade to a [paid plan](https://www.bugsplat.com/pricing).

If you plan on using BugSplat’s [free tier](https://www.bugsplat.com/docs/plans/free) of service, you’ll be automatically placed in it after the trial ends. The free tier plan comes with some service and total yearly crash report limits.
