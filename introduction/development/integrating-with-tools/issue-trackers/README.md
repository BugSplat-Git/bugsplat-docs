# Issue Trackers

BugSplat connects with popular defect trackers allowing users to create new issues with a couple of clicks directly from a crash or stack key.

This allows for teams to build issues that contain full crash information like symbolic call stacks as well as other crash-specific data that can help your team crush bugs faster.  Issues created from BugSplat also include hyperlinks that allows for users to quickly navigate between issues and the crash or stack key associated with them.

We're currently building a suite of tools that will allow for more bi-directional linking between defect trackers and the BugSplat app.  This will allow users to close, open, tag, or assign issues in either BugSplat or your preferred issue tracker and have that action persist everywhere.
