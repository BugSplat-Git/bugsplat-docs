# Issue Trackers

{% hint style="warning" %}
Some organizations restrict access to their issue tracker by IP address. If you need to allow access to BugSplat, add the IP address [23.22.79.2](https://www.whatismyip.com/23.22.79.2/?iref=home) to your whitelist.
{% endhint %}

BugSplat connects with popular defect trackers, allowing users to create new issues with a few clicks directly from a crash or stack key.

This allows teams to build issues that contain full crash information, like symbolic call stacks, as well as other crash-specific data that can help your team crush bugs faster. Issues created from BugSplat also include hyperlinks that allow users to quickly navigate between issues and the crash or stack key associated with them.

**Note** you can see our doc for automatically creating issues in your defect tracker from BugSplat databases [here](auto-creating-defects-from-bugsplat-databases-in-attached-third-party-trackers.md).
