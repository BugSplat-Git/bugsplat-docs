# Jira

Jira integration with BugSplat crash reports allows your team to create defects with a single-button click. Hyperlinks allow quick navigation from defects to crash reports and back. Defects created from BugSplat automatically include symbolic call stack information as well as other crash-specific data.

3. Enter your Username, Password, URL, and IssueType into the appropriate boxes on the BugSplat ‘[Options](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/options)’ page.
4. Click ‘Apply’.
5. Once a successful connection to Jira has been established, you will be able to select one of your projects from the project dropdown list.
6. After selecting your desired project, click ‘Apply’ again.

### Creating an issue in Jira from a BugSplat crash report
