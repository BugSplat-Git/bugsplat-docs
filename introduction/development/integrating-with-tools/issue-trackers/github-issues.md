# GitHub Issues

BugSplat's GitHub Issues integration allows your team to create defects from crash reports with only a couple clicks. Pushing crash reports to GitHub Issues creates hyperlinks in BugSplat and allows for quick navigation from crash reports to your defect tracker and back again. Defects created from BugSplat automatically include symbolic call stack information as well as other crash-specific data.
