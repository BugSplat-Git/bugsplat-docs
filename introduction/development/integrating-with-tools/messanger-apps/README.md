# Configurable Alerts

BugSplat provides tools for teams to get alerted the instant something changes in an application. 

These tools currently allow you to build alerts that show if your crash rate has increased to a certain number \(configurable to any number\) of crashes per minute or if a new type of crash is present in a certain database.

{% page-ref page="microsoft-teams.md" %}

{% page-ref page="discord.md" %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
BugSplat is currently building a new, more configurable, suite of alerts that will allow teams to get more granular on when and why they get notified about application performance.
