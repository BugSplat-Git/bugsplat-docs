# Microsoft Teams

BugSplatâ€™s Teams integration allows your team to receive alerts for new crashes and errors or new groups of crashes or errors. Receiving BugSplat alerts through Teams lets you stay on top of your application's stability and can serve as an early warning that something might be wrong.
