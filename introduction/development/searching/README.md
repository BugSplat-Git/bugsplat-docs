# Searching

BugSplat provides powerful searching, filtering, and grouping tools that help users better understand the various intricacies of their crash data. Users can build complex queries via the BugSplat search controls, share the results with co-workers, and export the results for use in other tools.

Need to isolate all crashes that happened before a certain date? Looking for any crash that contains a specific function anywhere in the call stack? Want to group crashes based on their IP Address? BugSplat can do it all! Crafting a search to isolate the crash data you need is straightforward and intuitive.

BugSpat's data can also be searched and filtered directly via our web-services [APIs](../web-services/paging-filtering-and-grouping.md).
