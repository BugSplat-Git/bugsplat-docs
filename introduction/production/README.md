# Production

The Production section covers documents that help put your application into production with BugSplat.

[**Support Responses**](setting-up-custom-support-responses.md) - are a custom message set by you that is displayed to an end-user as a new tab in their default browser after they experience a specific type of crash. They are useful for alerting users to known issues or passing along information important to fixing a defect.

[**Managing Versions**](managing-versions.md) - instructions on adding or removing symbols, retiring old versions you no longer wish to collect crashes from, and adding support for Full Memory Dumps.

[**Security and Compliance**](security-privacy-and-compliance/) - Overview of BugSplat's security program, SOC-2 and GDPR compliance, terms, privacy policy, and more.

[Regression Alerts](regression-alerts.md) - After a defect has been marked as closed, BugSplat can automatically identify when a crash recurs in a newer version and notify your team.
