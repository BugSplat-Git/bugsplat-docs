As part of the implementation process, Developer will identify user names and passwords that will be used to set up Developer’s account. Developer will be responsible and liable for the acts or omissions of any person who accesses the Services using passwords or access procedures provided to Developer. BugSplat reserves the right to refuse registration of, or to suspend or cancel, login IDs used by Developer to access the Services if Developer violates the terms and conditions set forth in these Terms.
