# GDPR & UK GDPR Compliance

On May 25, 2018, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) went into effect, establishing new global privacy rights for individuals in the European Union. Since then, the United Kingdom has adopted a parallel privacy framework known as **UK GDPR** following its departure from the EU.

At BugSplat, we take your data privacy seriously. We’ve worked hard to meet and exceed the obligations set out in both the **EU GDPR** and the **UK GDPR**.

### BugSplat as a Data Processor
