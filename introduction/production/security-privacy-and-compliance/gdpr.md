**On May 25th 2018 the EU General Data Protection Regulation \(GDPR\) became effective bringing new global data protection rights for individuals in the European Union.**

BugSplat operates as a processor of our customer's data.

**What we've done to comply with GDPR**

**Company**

* Consulted with external counsel to understand how GDPR affects BugSplat and our users.
* Assessed our current offering to understand where we need to offer changes to comply with GDPR
* Updated our data processing agreement \(DPA\) for customers processing information on behalf of EU and Swiss citizens.
* Reviewed all vendors that act as sub-processors for BugSplat data and entered into DPAs where necessary.

**Product**

* For some time, BugSplat has given our customers the option to prevent collection of personally identifiable information \(PII\) by automatically obfuscating user name, email, and IP address.
* Added the ability to modify the crash dialog to include a checkbox that allows users to give consent to their crash data being stored.
* Added the ability for customers to permanently delete a specific user, email, or IP address and the associated log files from all crash reports.

**Our Data Processing Agreement \(DPA\)**

If you have any questions about our DPA or wish to sign it, please send an email to [support@bugsplat.com](mailto:support@bugsplat.com).
