# Getting Started

Getting up and running with BugSplat is a well-documented and straightforward process that has been followed by thousands of developers and honed by constant iterations from the BugSplat support team. Following the six steps listed below is the quickest way to get started. It generally takes about as much time as to drink a [large mug](https://shop.spacex.com/collections/accessories/products/occupy-mars-heat-sensitive-terraforming-mug-new) of coffee.

### The BugSplat 6-Step Checklist

1. [ ] [Sign up for a BugSplat account ](signing-up-for-an-account-with-bugsplat.md)
2. [ ] [Create a database](create-a-new-database-in-bugsplat.md)
3. [ ] [Integrate with your application](integrations/)
4. [ ] [Submit a sample crash ](posting-a-test-crash/)
5. [ ] [Add your team members](adding-uses-to-your-account.md)
6. [ ] [Learn to use the app](../development/)

### More Details

Following the above steps will take new users from [creating](signing-up-for-an-account-with-bugsplat.md) and [configuring their account](create-a-new-database-in-bugsplat.md) through [integrating their application](integrations/) and[ posting a test crash](posting-a-test-crash/). 

Next, crash reporting is more [fun with friends](adding-uses-to-your-account.md) so adding team members to your BugSplat account is easy.

Once these steps are complete, users should learn more about using the BugSplat app in the [Development](../development/) section which has a handy [walkthrough of the BugSplat application](../development/using-the-app.md), 3rd party integration guides, and much more.
