# Desktop

BugSplat provides best-in-class support for Desktop applications. We support both native [C++](c++-native.md) and [.NET Framework](windows-.net-framework.md) version 3.5+ applications on Windows. For [macOS](os-x.md), we support OS X 10.7 or newer and also support crash reporting for ARM Macs. On [Linux](linux.md) systems, we support collecting native C++ crash reports via [Breakpad](../cross-platform/breakpad-1.md) and [Crashpad](../cross-platform/crashpad/). Take a look at the documentation articles below to configure crash reporting in your app.
