# Unreal Engine Plugin

## üèó Installation

You may choose to add BugSplat through the Unreal Marketplace or add the plugin to your Unreal project manually.

#### Install from Marketplace

[Install BugSplat from the Unreal Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/bugsplat)

#### Install Manually

1. Navigate to your project folder containing your `[ProjectName].uproject` file.
2. Create a `Plugins` folder if it does not already exist.
3. Create a `BugSplat` folder in the `Plugins` folder and copy the contents of the [bugsplat-unreal](https://github.com/BugSplat-Git/bugsplat-unreal) repo into the `BugSplat` folder.
4. In the Unreal Editor, ensure you can access the BugSplat plugin via `Edit > Project Settings` and scroll to the `BugSplat` section under `Plugins`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

BugSplat's Unreal plugin currently supports adding crash reporting to Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS games. With a few clicks, the BugSplat plugin can be configured to automatically upload symbol files so crash report stack traces display function names and line numbers.

To get started, generate a Client ID and Client Secret via the [Integrations](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/database/integrations) page.

Next, open the BugSplat plugin menu in the Unreal Editor via `Edit > Project Settings`. Scroll to the `BugSplat` section of `Project Settings` and add values for `Database`, `Application`, `Version`, `Client ID`, and `Client Secret`:

### Windows, macOS, and Linux

BugSplat leverages Unreal's `CrashReportClient` to provide crash reporting for Windows, macOS, and Linux games. Be sure to update your project settings and enable `Include Crash Reporter` and `Include Debug Files in Shipping Builds`:

To configure `CrashReportClient` to post to BugSplat, the `DataRouterUrl` value needs to be added to `DefaultEngine.ini`. The `bugsplat-unreal` plugin automatically updates the value for `DataRouterUrl` when the `Update Engine DefaultEngine.ini` option is enabled. Please note the `DataRouterUrl` value is global and is shared across all packaged builds created by the affected engine. To override the `DataRouterUrl` value a package build uses, you may optionally use the `Update Packaged Game INI` button under the `Tools` section.

In order to get function names and line numbers in crash reports, you'll need to upload your game's `.exe`, `.dll`, and `.pdb` files. To upload debug symbols for reach build, ensure that the `Enable Automatic Symbol Uploads` option is selected. When selected, a script to execute [symbol-upload](https://github.com/BugSplat-Git/symbol-upload) will be added to the `PostBuildSteps` field in `BugSplat.uplugin`. The symbol upload script will run automatically when your game is built.

### iOS and Android

Before attempting to use the BugSplat plugin to capture crashes on Mobile, please ensure you've completed the [iOS](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/setting-up-an-unreal-engine-project-for-ios/) and [Android](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/android-support-for-unreal-engine/) quickstart guides.

In order to get function names and line numbers in your iOS crash reports, please make the following changes in the `iOS` section of `Project Settings`.

| Option                                                 | Value |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----- |
| Generate dSYMs for code debugging and profiling        | true  |
| Generate dSYMs as a bundle for third-party crash tools | true  |
| Support bitcode in shipping                            | false |

To enable crash reporting, ensure the `Enable iOS Crash Reporting` and `Enable Android Crash Reporting` options are selected.

Note that sometimes iOS applications won't crash while the USB cable is connected. If this happens, disconnect the USB cable and re-run the application to trigger a crash.

### Xbox and PlayStation

BugSplat can provide instructions for implementing Unreal crash reporting on Xbox and PlayStation. Please email us at [support@bugsplat.com](mailto:support@bugsplat.com) for more info.

## üèÉ Usage

Once you've installed the plugin, add the following C++ snippet to your game to generate a sample crash.

```
UE_LOG(LogTemp, Fatal, TEXT("BugSplat!"));
```

Run your application and submit a crash report.

On Desktops, submit a crash report via the Unreal CrashReportClient dialog that appears at crash time. We have developed a handy guide on how to customize the Unreal CrashReportClient dialog available [here](https://www.bugsplat.com/blog/game-dev/customizing-unreal-engine-crash-dialog/).

On iOS, after a crash occurs, restart the game and tap the `Send Report` option when prompted. On Android, crashes are submitted automatically at crash time.

Once you've submitted a crash report, navigate to the [Crashes](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/crashes) page. On the Crashes page, click the link in the ID column.

If everything is configured correctly, you should see something that resembles the following:
