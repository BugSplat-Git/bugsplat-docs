# Ionic

## Overview

[Ionic](https://ionicframework.com) is an open-source SDK for hybrid mobile app development, and an excellent tool for developing cross-platform applications. Our integration allows you to track crashes from your Ionic application - giving you detailed insight into your critical issues.

To enable your Ionic application to work with BugSplat crash reporting, view our [Angular](../web/angular.md) doc.

If you have any questions please email us at [support@bugsplat.com](mailto:support@bugsplat.com).
