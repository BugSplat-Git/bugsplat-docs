# Platform Integrations

BugSplat works in a wide range of environments and languages to give developers the best possible data on their application defectsâ€”no matter where they are occurring.

**Use the links below** for guides that will help you configure your application to send crash or error data to BugSplat across various languages and platforms.

If you are creating a new account, you'll have an option to access these documents through the new user walkthrough tool which assists in the configuration and setup of new accounts.
