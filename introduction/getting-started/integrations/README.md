# Platform Integrations

BugSplat works in a wide range of environments and languages to give developers the best possible data on their application defectsâ€”no matter where they are occurring. 

Use the links below for guides that will help you configure your application to send crash or error data to BugSplat across various languages and platforms.

If you are creating a new account, you'll have an option to access these documents through the new user walkthrough tool which assists in the configuration and setup of new accounts.
