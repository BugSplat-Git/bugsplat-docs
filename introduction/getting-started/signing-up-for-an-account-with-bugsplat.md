Once you've hit **Sign Up** you'll be a registered user of BugSplat. &#x20;

Then, you'll be presented with a screen welcoming you to BugSplat.  Here you can either go through a guided onboarding which aids in quickly configuring new accounts, or you can skip the onboarding and go directly to the [Dashboard](../development/using-the-app.md#dashboard) page.
