### Step 4: Submitting a Sample Crash

Once you've selected your platform or SDK, you'll be taken to our documentation page. To quickly submit a sample crash without going through the full integration process, scroll down to the bottom right of the page and click the button labeled "**In a hurry? Post a sample crash instead**." This allows you to skip the full integration process for now and submit a sample crash directly.
