# MyConsoleCrasher (C++)

Before you enable BugSplat in your Windows C++ application, you may want to take a moment to experiment with our `MyConsoleCrasher` sample application.

To get started, download the BugSplat Microsoft Windows Native C++ SDK by clicking [here](https://app.bugsplat.com/browse/download_item.php?item=native). Download and unzip the contents of `BugSplatNative.zip`. After extracting the downloaded SDK, navigate to the `Samples` folder and open the `MyConsoleCrasher.vcxproj` file with Visual Studio.

1. Open `MyConsoleCrasher.vcxproj` with Visual Studio 2022+
2. Define values for `BUGSPLAT_DATABASE`, `APPLICATION_NAME`, and `APPLICATION_VERSION` in `Samples\MyConsoleCrasher\MyConsoleCrasher.h`
3. Create a Client ID and Client Secret pair for your BugSplat database on the [Integrations](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/settings/database/integrations) page
4. Create a file `Samples\MyConsoleCrasher\Scripts\env.ps1` and populate it with the following (being sure to substitute your `your-client-id` and `your-client-secret` values from the previous step):

```
$BUGSPLAT_CLIENT_ID = "your-client-id"
$BUGSPLAT_CLIENT_SECRET = "your-client-secret"
```

5. Rebuild the project and run it outside of the Visual Studio debugger (Ctrl+F5). This is important since the debugger interferes with the BugSplat library’s exception handling. You should see a dialog such as that shown below:

![BugSplat Crash Dialog](<../../../../.gitbook/assets/bugsplat-crash-dialog (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (2) (3) (2) (1) (2).png>)

Enter some descriptive text to help you identify the crash you are about to upload. Click the `Send Error Report` button, and voilà! The report will be sent! In the BugSplat web app, look for the crash report with the description you entered.

Finally, experiment with other features of the library by examining the `MyConsoleCrasher` source code and supplying different command-line arguments.
