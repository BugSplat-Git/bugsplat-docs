# Adding users to your account

After signing up for a BugSplat account, itâ€™s important to add your team members to your company so that they can access the team's crash data. Crash reporting is better with friends.

### **Quickly add a team member to all your company databases**

To add a team member to all your company's databases, simply add them via the [Company](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/company) page. They will receive an email providing a prompt about setting up their account.

### **Adding team members to specific databases**

Only need to add a team member to a specific subset of databases? Navigate to the [Users](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/users) page and select the desired database from the dropdown selector.

Once you've selected the right database, click the **Add User** button. This will prompt you to insert an email address of your team member. Once invited, they will receive an email allowing them to set up their account.

Repeat this process for all desired databases.
