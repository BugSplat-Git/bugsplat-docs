# Requesting access to your team's BugSplat account

If your team or company already has an account with BugSplat, you can request access from your team member.

BugSplat has a tool that allows you to [Request Access](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/sign-up/team-access/) to join an account from a team member who already has access to your team's account.

Note that for security reasons, there will be no warning if the email you send to a team member isn't received. If you do not receive an email granting you access that you double-check to make sure you submitted the right email and try again.
