# How to fix BugSplats when your video game is crashing

BugSplat is a tool that helps software and video game developers understand what happened when their programs crash during use. It helps them build better and more stable games for you, their users.

Seeing a BugSplat means that the company behind your video game cares about its quality and is working incredibly hard to give you the best experience possible.

Because BugSplat is just a tool the developer of your game uses, we can’t provide any specific help with your crash.

We suggest you go to your video game’s support page / help forum and search for common issues there.

Most of the time only a simple fix is needed to remove the problem that brought you to [bugsplat.com](https://www.bugsplat.com/) searching for answers.
