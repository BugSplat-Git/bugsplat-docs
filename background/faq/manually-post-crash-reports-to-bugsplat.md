# Manually post crash reports to BugSplat

Our [Post a Crash Report](https://app.bugsplat.com/postcrashreport/) page is used for manually uploading a BugSplat crash report.

This can be necessary, for example, when a crash occurs on a computer not connected to the Internet.

When BugSplat can't upload the file automatically, the zip file name containing the crash report data is displayed in the BugSplat crash report dialog.

To complete the crash posting process, browse for the zip file using the Choose File button on the [Post a Crash Report](https://app.bugsplat.com/postcrashreport/) page. After you've selected the file, use the Upload button to send us the report.
