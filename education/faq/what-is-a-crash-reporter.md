# What is a crash reporter?

A crash reporter is a piece of code that helps developers find when, where, and how frequently their software crashes while in use.

The role of a crash reporter is to identify report crash details and to provide an alert when there are crashes. They can be used for code that is being tested or code that is in production.

Crash reports often include data such as stack traces, details on the operating system where the crash occurred, the version of software, and much more.

These reports help software developers of all types to diagnose and fix the underlying problem causing the crashes.
