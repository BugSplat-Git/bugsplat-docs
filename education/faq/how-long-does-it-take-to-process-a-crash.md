# How long does it take to process a crash?

A crash should always appear as soon as it arrives at our site.&#x20;

After arrival, it will show as 'pending' until our processors can run a debugger to analyze the crash and create the symbolicated call stack. This processing is typically pretty quick; however, it can take longer in some circumstances. It's rare for it to take more than 15 minutes.

If you see a problem where your crash isn't processing, try hitting the 'reprocess' button on the crash page.&#x20;

And if that doesn't fix the issue, please contact support.  We'll be happy to investigate!
