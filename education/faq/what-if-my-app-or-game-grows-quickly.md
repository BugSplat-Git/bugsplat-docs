#### How BugSplat Handles Growth

1. **Crash Visibility**\
   BugSplat gives you continuous insight into the number of crashes your application is experiencing. This transparency helps you monitor crash volume and plan ahead for scaling needs.  See this your [Billing](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/company/billing) page to lean how to view your usage.&#x20;
2. **Crash Limits and Lockout Mechanism**\
   Every plan includes a defined crash report limit. If your app or game exceeds its crash limit:
   * **Temporary Lockout**: In some cases where you're well over your limit, access to crash data is limited, but BugSplat continues collecting and storing crash reports.  It's still there for you being collected.
   * **Easy Upgrades**: Once you upgrade to a plan that accommodates the higher crash volume, all stored crash data becomes accessible.
3. **Real-Time Alerts**\
   BugSplatâ€™s [**alerting suite**](../../introduction/development/integrating-with-tools/messanger-apps/) keeps you informed of crash rates and limits with customizable notifications. This ensures youâ€™re always aware of your applicationâ€™s crash performance and usage.
4. **Scalable Plans for Any Size**\
   BugSplat [plans are designed to grow with you](../../administration/billing/plans-and-billing-guide.md):
   * Our free plan is ideal for small-scale projects or early development stages.
   * As your app or game grows, you can seamlessly transition to plans that accommodate millions of crashes per month.
   * BugSplat is trusted by some of the largest games in the industry for handling massive crash volumes.
