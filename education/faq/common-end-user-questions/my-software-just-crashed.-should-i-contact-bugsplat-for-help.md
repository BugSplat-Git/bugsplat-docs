# My software just crashed. Should I contact BugSplat for help?

Unfortunately, BugSplat cannot help individual users of an application with specific issues that are causing their software to crash.  The BugSplat team does not have any insight into what might be causing application crashes.

BugSplat is something called a [Crash Reporter](what-is-a-crash-reporter.md) that simply helps developers find and fix application defects, bugs, and crashes. 

You can follow [these simple steps](how-to-fix-bugsplats.md) to try and find the cause of your application's crashes.

If that doesn't work please try finding and contacting support staff at the company which builds or supports the application which is crashing.  Often a company will answer support-related questions from email an email formated as support@\[insert-name-of-company\].com.
