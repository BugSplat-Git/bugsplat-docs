# What should I do if I get a BugSplat?

When you get a BugSplat, it means that the program you were running crashed.

The best thing to do is fill out the User Description box and hit “Send.” The user description of the event right before the crash in combination with a snapshot from BugSplat of the crash is immensely helpful for developers when they go to your bugs.

If you have repeatedly gotten BugSplats, you should search for help from the developer of your software or video game. Try searching for a help forum or support site maintained by the company that developed the application that is crashing. Most of the time only a simple fix is required.
