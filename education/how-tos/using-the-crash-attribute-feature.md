# Using the Crash Attribute Feature

**Overview:** BugSplat introduces the Custom Crash Report Attributes feature, enabling the addition of user-defined attributes to crash reports. These attributes consist of name-value pairs that can be integrated into your applicationâ€™s crash reporting setup. Each custom attribute can be displayed as a column on the crashes page, and all attributes are visible on the crash detail pages.
