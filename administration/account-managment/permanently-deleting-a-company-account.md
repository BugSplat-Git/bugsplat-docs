# Deleting a Company Account

Currently, there is no way to manually delete a company's BugSplat account permanently through the app. 

To permanently remove your account, or your company's account, please contact [support](mailto:support@bugsplat.com) and we'll delete your account after verifying that you're an admin on the account.
