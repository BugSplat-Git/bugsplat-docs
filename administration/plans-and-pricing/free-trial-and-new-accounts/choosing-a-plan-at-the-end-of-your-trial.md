# Choosing a Plan

Picking a plan at the end of your trial is seamless. When your trial is up, choose the plan that is right for you. You can see more about our plans on the [pricing](https://www.bugsplat.com/pricing) page.

All of your databases and crashes will stay put for you and be there when you have signed up for an account.

To choose a plan navigate to the [Account](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/account) page inside of the web app. There you will be prompted to choose a plan and enter a credit card.

You can also pay for plans annually - to learn more about payment options visit here.
