# Annually Invoiced Plan Upgrades

If your account has exceeded its plan limits - for plans paying annual only crash volume matters - then you will be automatically upgraded to a plan which covers your usage.

BugSplat will only inquire about upgrading accounts that are invoiced annually when an account has exceeded its monthly volume limit and its annual volume limit.  &#x20;

You can see your usage on the [Billing](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/settings/company/billing) page in Settings. If anything is in 'red' then it means that you're over your limit.

When an account that pays annually is out of compliance (as shown above) a member of the BugSplat sales team will reach out and discuss upgrading to a plan that better fits the user's new crash volume.&#x20;

Note that this increase must be a sustained crash volume increase - we are forgiving of crash spikes and seak to put all our users on plans they deem fair.
