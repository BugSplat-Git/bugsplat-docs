# Monthly Plan Upgrades

If your account has exceeded its plan limits - users or annual allotted crash volume - then you will be automatically upgraded to a plan which covers your usage.

Crash report volume upgrades only occur when an account has exceeded its monthly volume limit and its annual volume limit.   

You can see your usage on the [Company](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/company) page. If anything is in 'red' then it means that you're over your limit.

When this happens, the account admin \(see [here](../billing-and-plan-managment/updating-email-address-for-receipts-and-invocies.md) for instruction on how to change the email addresses that receive upgrade alerts\) will get an email letting you know that your plan has changed. Your [Account](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/account) page and your next invoice will both reflect this upgrade.

What this means is that you'll have roughly a month before you are charged for a larger plan, giving you a window to get back into compliance and set your account back to its original setting.

Have users that don't need access any longer? Delete them! Don't use an old database anymore - feel free to retire it.

If you believe you shouldn't have been upgraded please view our [Fair-Refund](refund-policy.md) policy and then [contact us.](mailto:sales@bugsplat.com)
