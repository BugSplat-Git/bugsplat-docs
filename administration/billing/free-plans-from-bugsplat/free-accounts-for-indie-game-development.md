# Indie Game Development

### Overview

We're committed to supporting those who are giving back, working hard to learn, or hacking together something fun.

Because of that, BugSplat has a free plan or those working on building an indie video game on little or no budget.

Additionally, BugSplat provides a 25% discount for Team and Business plans for Indie Developers who used the Free Plan during development.

### Indie Game Dev Free Plan:

If you're unaffiliated with a funded studio and currently developing your game, you probably qualify for a free plan from BugSplat.

To start out, Indie devs get annual 25,000 free monthly crashes and errors, one user seat, and one application.&#x20;

If your team has special circumstances you can [hi@bugsplat.com](mailto:hi@bugsplat.com) and tell us a little bit about yourself and your game.  We'll likely add additional users or crashes if needed.

#### How long does this plan last?

Once you launch your game or secure funding, we will work with you to find a plan that works for your game, team, and company and send you a 25% discount code for your first 6 months of using a paid account at BugSplat.

#### How can I support BugSplat during the free plan?

First off, it's very nice that you're thinking of us. We're touched.  &#x20;

There is no responsibility on your part to help us in exchange for getting free crash reporting. &#x20;

If you're determined to be super nice—how dare you—you could mention us positively to your friends and coworkers. Please also consider including a link to our website in your documentation.

BugSplat is a [bootstrapped startup](https://www.bugsplat.com/about/) and we grow largely on the back of positive word of mouth from our users.
