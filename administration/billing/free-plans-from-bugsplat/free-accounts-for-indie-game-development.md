# Free Crash Reporting for Indie Game Development

At BugSplat, we are passionate about empowering indie game developers navigating the complexities of game development on limited budgets. To support your creativity and hard work, we've introduced the Indie Game Plan, offering a free year of our Team Plan features to help you bring your vision to life.

**Indie Game Plan: A Year of Free Support**

Tailored for indie developers without the backing of funded studios, the Indie Game Plan provides the same benefits as our Team Plan for an entire year, at no cost. This includes:

* **A set allowance of 25,000 monthly crashes and errors**, enabling you to efficiently track and fix issues.
* **Access to key Team Plan features**, like intelligent crash grouping, automated symbol uploads, GitHub integration, and email notifications, all designed to streamline your development process.

This plan is our way of supporting the initial stages of your game development journey, ensuring you have access to essential debugging tools without the financial burden.

#### **Special Circumstances and Resource Expansion**

We recognize that indie game projects come with their own set of unique challenges. If your project's demands exceed the resources provided by the Indie Game Plan, we encourage you to reach out to us at hi@bugsplat.com. In special circumstances, we may be able to adjust your crash volume or storage space. Keep in mind, though, that if your needs consistently outstrip the base resources, exploring our paid plans may be the next step to ensuring your project's ongoing support.

#### **Connect with Us on Discord**

Join our Discord community to engage with a network of fellow indie developers and the BugSplat team. It's a great place to share experiences, seek advice, and find inspiration. Become part of our supportive environment by connecting with us at [BugSplat Discord Community](https://discord.gg/K4KjjRV5ve).

#### **Continuing Support After Your Free Year**

We hope the Indie Game Plan significantly contributes to your project's success. If, after your free year with BugSplat, you find yourself in a position where extending the free service is necessary, please don't hesitate to contact us at hi@bugsplat.com with your reasons. We understand that every project's journey is different, and we're here to discuss how we can continue supporting yours.

#### **Your Support for BugSplat**

While there's no obligation to support us in return, we're grateful for any positive mentions or inclusion of a BugSplat link in your game's documentation. Our growth is driven by your success stories and the kind words you share about your experience with us.

With the Indie Game Plan, BugSplat is committed to making your game development process smoother and more manageable, so you can focus on what you do best—creating amazing games.
