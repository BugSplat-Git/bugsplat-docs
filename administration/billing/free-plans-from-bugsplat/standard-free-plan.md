# Free Plan Overview

BugSplat wants to help all hackers, those getting started, and do-it-yourselfers to have access to world-class crash reporting. Because of that, we provide a Free Plan that covers one user, one user group, up to 15,000 monthly errors and crashes and a suite of key features to help your project succeed.

#### How long does the free plan last?

The Free plan is free forever. Consider upgrading to a paid plan if you need more users, crashes, storage space, or additional features.

#### Are there other free plans?

Yup! If you're an [indie game dev](free-accounts-for-indie-game-development.md), [working in education](bugsplat-free-accounts-for-students-and-teachers.md), supporting a not-for-profit [open source project](bugsplat-free-accounts-for-not-for-profit-open-source-projects.md), or working on a [good cause](good-causes.md), we've got some free plans for you to check out.

### How to get started

To get started with the Standard Free Plan, follow the below steps:

1. Sign up for an account [here](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/sign-up).
