# Solo Developer Plan

BugSplat wants to help all hackers, those getting started, and do-it-yourselfers to have access to world-class crash reporting. Because of that, we provide a Solo Developer Free Plan which covers one user, one application, up to 25,000 monthly errors and crashes, and a suite of key features.

#### How long does the free plan last?

The Solo plan is forever. If you need more users, databases, or crashes, consider upgrading to a paid plan.

#### Are there other free plans?&#x20;

Yup!  If you're an [indie game dev](free-accounts-for-indie-game-development.md), [working in education](bugsplat-free-accounts-for-students-and-teachers.md), supporting a not-for-profit [open source project](bugsplat-free-accounts-for-not-for-profit-open-source-projects.md), or working on a [good cause](good-causes.md), we've got some free plans for you to check out.

### How to get started

To get started with the Standard Free Plan, follow the below steps:&#x20;

1. Sign up for an account [here](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/sign-up).
2. Follow the [Gettings Started](../../../introduction/getting-started/) docs to set up your account.
3. Use BugSplat normally and stay within the guidelines of the plan (1 user, 1 application, and less than 25,000 monthly errors and crashes).
