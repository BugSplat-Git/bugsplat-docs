# Open-Source

### Overview

We're committed to supporting those who are giving back, working hard to learn, or hacking together something fun.

Because of that, BugSplat has an Extended Free Tier Plan for nonprofit, open-source projects that are helping to build and grow the fabric of the internet.&#x20;

### Here are the rules:

If you're a contributor or moderator of a nonprofit, open-source project that could benefit from crash or error reporting, you likely qualify for our Extended Free Tier Plan.

For users and teams that qualify, you'll get 50,000 free monthly crashes and errors plus integrations with defect trackers.

If you're wondering if you qualify but are not sure, please send an email to [hi@bugsplat.com](mailto:hi@bugsplat.com) and tell us a little bit about yourself and your project.

#### How long does this plan last?

This plan lasts as long as your open-source project remains in good standing with BugSplat and stays a not-for-profit or non-revenue generating project.

#### How can I support BugSplat during the free plan?

First off, it's very nice that you're thinking of us. We're touched.&#x20;

There is absolutely no responsibility on your part to help us in exchange for getting free crash reporting. &#x20;

If you're determined to be super nice—how dare you—you could mention us positively online or to your friends and coworkers. Please also consider including a link to our website in your documentation or in the README file of your repo.

BugSplat is a [bootstrapped startup](https://www.bugsplat.com/about/) and we grow largely on the back of positive word of mouth from our users.
