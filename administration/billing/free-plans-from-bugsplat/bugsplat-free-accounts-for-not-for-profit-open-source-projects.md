# Open-Source

At BugSplat, we're inspired by the power of open-source projects to innovate, educate, and break down barriers in the tech community. Our commitment to these values is why we offer a tailored Open Source Plan, designed to support the development and sustainability of impactful open-source projects around the world.

#### **Open Source Plan: Tailored Support for Community-Driven Projects**

Our Open Source Plan is an extension of our commitment to supporting projects that contribute positively to the fabric of computing and the Internet. This plan is specifically for non-profit, open-source projects that leverage crash reporting to improve their applications, thereby enhancing the user experience and overall project quality.

* **Customized Support:** Understanding that open-source projects vary widely in scope and size, we collaborate with project contributors to determine the level of support needed. While the default offering mirrors our Team Plan, providing an annual allowance of 25,000 monthly crashes and 250GB of storage, we're open to adjusting these resources to meet the specific needs of your project.
* **Eligibility and Application:** If you're contributing to or moderating a non-profit, open-source project and believe that BugSplat’s crash reporting could benefit your work, you likely qualify for our Open Source Plan. We invite you to reach out to us at hi@bugsplat.com with details about your project, its goals, and how BugSplat can assist. Our team is keen to understand your project's impact and work with you to ensure you have the support you need.
* **Plan Duration:** This plan is designed to grow with your project. As long as your open-source project remains not-for-profit and maintains its positive standing within the BugSplat community, the support continues. We view our relationship with open-source projects as a partnership, one where we evolve our support as your project grows.

#### **Connect with Us on Discord**

To further support our open-source community, we extend an invitation to join our Discord server. It’s a space for collaboration, sharing challenges and solutions, and connecting with the BugSplat team and other open-source enthusiasts. Engage with us at [BugSplat Discord Community](https://discord.gg/K4KjjRV5ve) to become part of a network committed to making a difference through open-source development.

#### **Supporting BugSplat**

While there's no obligation, any form of support for BugSplat is deeply appreciated. Whether it's a mention in your project's documentation, a shout-out online, or including a link to our website in your project's README, your support helps us continue offering resources to the open-source community.

The Open Source Plan embodies our belief in the transformative power of open-source projects. At BugSplat, we're not just providing tools; we're investing in partnerships that drive innovation and accessibility in technology, supporting projects that share our vision of a more inclusive and open digital world.
