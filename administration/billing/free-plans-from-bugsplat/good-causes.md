# Good Causes

### Overview

We're committed to supporting those who are giving back and making a real difference in important fields. 

Because of that, BugSplat has an Extended Free Tier Plan for anyone working on human rights, world poverty, environmental sustainability, or underrepresentation in tech.



### Here are the rules:

If you're a member of a company or organization that you believe might fit the above criteria and benefit from crash or error reporting, you likely qualify for our Extended Free Tier Plan.

For users and teams that qualify, you'll get annual 500,000 free annual crashes plus integrations with defect trackers.

If you're wondering if you qualify but are not sure, please send an email to our product manager Joey \(joey@bugsplat.com\) and tell him a little bit about yourself and your project or community.

#### How long does this plan last?

This plan lasts as long as your open-source project remains in good standing with BugSplat and stays a not-for-profit, non-revenue generating project.

#### How can I support BugSplat during the free plan?

First off, it's very nice that you're thinking of us. We're touched. 

There is absolutely no responsibility on your part to help us in exchange for getting free crash reporting.  

If you're determined to be super nice - how dare you - you could mention us positively online or to your friends and coworkers.  Please also consider including a link to our website in your documentation.

BugSplat is a [bootstrapped startup](https://www.bugsplat.com/about/) and we grow largely on the back of positive word of mouth from our users.
