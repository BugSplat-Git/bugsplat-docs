# Pricing FAQ's

#### What is a Crash?

BugSplat client libraries integrate with your code to capture exception information and send it to the BugSplat website. That package of information is called a crash report. Each crash report equals one crash.

#### Can I pay annually?

Absolutely. You can see the annual prices by toggling the button above the pricing table to ‘Annual.’ There’s a 5% discount if you choose to pay upfront for your plan. If this option is tantalizing to you—send a note to sales. You’ll be given the option to pay by check or bank transfer.

#### What payment methods do you accept?

BugSplat accepts all major credit cards as payment for our monthly plans. Credit card payments are handled via Stripe.

#### I need an enterprise plan—how does that work?

If you think an enterprise plan is right for your team, please send us a note and we’ll be in touch shortly.

#### Where do I sign up for a plan?

You can sign up for a plan at any point on the [Account](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/account) page inside of your application. If you wish to pay annually please send us an email or chat with us in the app.

#### What if I change my mind?

No problem. You can cancel at any time, no questions asked. You can even export your data through our API. If you’re curious, you can read our [fair-refund policy](../upgrades/refund-policy.md).

#### Can I cancel my plan?

Absolutely. If you pay monthly via a credit card, simply navigate to the Company page and click the 'Manage your plan →' in the Usage section.  From there you can cancel your plan.  Please reach out to sales@bugsplat with any questions. We'll make the process stress-free.

#### Is there a money-back guarantee?

Of course—read more about our [fair-refund-policy](../upgrades/refund-policy.md).
