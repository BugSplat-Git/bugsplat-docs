# How to Sign Up for a BugSplat Plan

**Welcome to BugSplat!** Here's your straightforward guide to getting started with our crash reporting service. Let's dive into how you can sign up, evaluate, and choose the plan that's just right for your development needs.

**Getting Started: The 14-Day Free Trial**

Your journey with BugSplat begins with our [14-day Free Trial](free-trial.md). We believe the best way to understand the value of BugSplat is by giving it a spin, risk-free. Here's how to kick things off:

1. **Sign Up for the Free Trial:** Head over to our sign-up page and create your BugSplat account. No credit card required; just your enthusiasm for making your software the best it can be.

#### **Deciding Your Next Steps Post-Trial**

When your trial ends you'll be shown a screen asking for options about the future of your account.  You'll be able to choose:

* **Continue with the Free Plan:** If you're still exploring or if your project is small-scale, our Free Plan might be just what you need.
* **Upgrade to a Paid Plan:** Ready for more? You can jump straight into selecting a Team or Business plan tailored to your project's scale.
* **Request More Time:** Sometimes, you need a bit more time to decide. We get it. Let us know, and we can extend your trial.

**Upgrading Anytime: A Step-by-Step Guide**

Whether you're still in your trial or using the Free Plan, upgrading is a breeze:

1. **Visit the Billing Page:** Navigate to [your account's Billing page](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/company/billing). Remember, this step requires non-restricted user access.
2.  **Hit 'Upgrade ✨':** Inside the Billing Page, you'll find the Upgrade button. A click here is your first step towards unlocking BugSplat's full potential.

4.  **Customize Your Plan:** Select how many monthly crashes and errors you need and the amount of storage that suits your team. Then, decide if you want to pay monthly or annually—the latter saves you the equivalent of two months!
