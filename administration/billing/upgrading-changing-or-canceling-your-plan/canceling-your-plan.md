# Canceling Your Plan

We understand that needs change, and there might come a time when you need to cancel your BugSplat plan. We aim to make this process as straightforward as possible, ensuring you can make the best decisions for your projects without hassle.

**Monthly Billed Accounts:** If you're on a monthly billing cycle, canceling your BugSplat plan can be done directly from the [Billing page](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/company/billing). Simply select 'Update Card,' then choose the 'Cancel Plan' option. Your plan will be terminated at the end of your current billing period, preventing any future charges.
