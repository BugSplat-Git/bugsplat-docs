# Updating Tax and VAT Information

Current account holders can now update their tax and VAT information through the Billing portal.&#x20;

To do this:

1. Navigate to the Billing page in Settings at [https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/company/billing](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/company/billing)
2. Click on the 'Manage your plan' button

This will bring you to the plan management portal where you can update various account details, including tax and VAT information.

In this portal, you can:

* Update your credit card information
* Change your billing address
* Modify the email that receives billing information
* Add or update VAT (Value Added Tax) information

Adding or updating VAT information is particularly important for businesses operating in countries that use a VAT system. Ensuring your VAT details are correct helps with accurate billing and compliance with local tax regulations.
