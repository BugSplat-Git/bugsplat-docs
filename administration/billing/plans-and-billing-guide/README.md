## Choosing a plan

BugSplat offers several different plans that each have different features and limits, allowing you to choose the plan and features that meet you and your team’s needs.&#x20;

Determining which plan is right for you or your team depends on what you are specifically looking for out of your plan.&#x20;

### Solo plan

The Solo plan is BugSplat's free-to-use plan that's great for individual developers working on a single project.  It comes with 25,000 monthly crash and error reports for one [app](./#what-is-an-app).  Key features like Github and Gitlab integrations as well as email alerts are also included.

Interested in the Solo plan?  Accounts default to this plan after the [14-day free trial](../free-trial.md).   &#x20;

### Team plan&#x20;

The Team plan is perfect for smaller teams that require up to 100,000 monthly crashes and errors.  The Team plan comes with 4 users and 2 [apps](./#what-is-an-app) and has the option to add more of both for a low monthly cost.

Additionally, Team plan account holders get expanded [defect tracker](../../../introduction/development/integrating-with-tools/#issue-trackers) integrations, [notifications & alerts](../../../introduction/development/integrating-with-tools/#configurable-alerts) via chat tools, [API](../../../introduction/development/web-services/api.md) access, and help us contribute to [OneTreePlanted](../../../about/who-is-bugsplat/charitable-giving.md#one-tree-planted).

See all of the features that come with the Team plan on the [Plans page](https://www.bugsplat.com/plans/).

### Business plan&#x20;

The Business plan is the best choice for medium or large teams - as well as anyone supporting applications that require more than 100,000 monthly crashes and errors.

The Business plan is the most customizable plan as it allows account-holders to configure their account to process up to 1 million monthly crashes and errors. &#x20;

Out of the box, the Business plan comes with 100,000 monthly crashes and errors, 4 users, and 3 [apps](./#what-is-an-app) with the ability to purchase more user seats and apps.

Finally, the Business Plan comes with additional features like advanced user management tools for managing larger teams,  user privacy tools like[ PII obfuscation](../../../introduction/production/security-privacy-and-compliance/avoid-collecting-personally-identifiable-information-pii.md) & custom [crash and error expiry](../../../introduction/production/security-privacy-and-compliance/crash-expiry.md), and [fractional crash processing](what-is-high-volume-fractional-crash-processing.md).

See all of the features that come with the Team plan on the [Plans page](https://www.bugsplat.com/plans/).

### Enterprise plan

BugSplat's Enterprise plans are for enterprise-scale customers and account holders who need custom agreements and plans.  Enterprise plans are fixed-rate, tiered subscriptions that allow for volume-based discounts on annual reports, users, and applications.

Team's looking to take advantage of the Enterprise can benefit from volume-based discounts, custom agreements, and other benefits.

## Paying for your plan

This button brings up the Update Plan pop-up that allows you to select your plan type (Business or Team), monthly crash volume, number of users, number of apps, and payment period (monthly or yearly).  Once you've chosen the desired plan specifications hit **Update** at the bottom right to bring up the review and payment method page. &#x20;

For our Team and Business plans, we accept all major credit cards. &#x20;

For Enterprise plans, account holders are able to pay annually via bank transfers and check.

## Upgrading and changing your plan

Team and Business account holders can upgrade or change their plan at any point during their billing cycle.  To upgrade or change your plan visit the [Billing](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/settings/company/billing) page and click on the **Update Plan** button.&#x20;

The Update Plan button will allow you to change account settings like plan type, total users, total applications, and monthly crash & error volume.  Additionally, you'll be given the option to pay annually.&#x20;

All upgrades take into account the point in the current billing cycle and pro-rate accordingly. &#x20;

## General questions on plans and billing

#### What is a crash or error?

BugSplat client libraries integrate with your code to capture exception information and send it to the BugSplat website. That package of information is called a crash or error report. Each report equals one crash or error.

#### How many crashes do I need?

Choose the lowest volume plan that will cover your current annual crash rate. If you don’t know how many crashes you’re likely to post in a year, don't hesitate to get in touch with [sales@bugsplat.com](mailto:sales@bugsplat.com), and we can assist with an estimate.

#### How do I integrate BugSplat?

Adding BugSplat to your application is a straightforward and well-documented process detailed in full in the [Getting Started](https://docs.bugsplat.com/introduction/getting-started) section of our docs. After you sign up for a free trial, BugSplat will walk you through the process of configuring your app or game to send crash and error data to BugSplat.

#### Are prices for individual projects?

No, BugSplat encourages using your account for multiple projects or games. Each project should be managed under a different "app", and if your account run's out of "apps", then it's easy and economical to add more to your plan.

#### Can I pay yearly?

Absolutely. You can see the annual prices by toggling the button above the pricing table to "Annual". There’s a 20% discount if you choose to pay upfront for your plan.

#### What currency are plans listed in?

All amounts listed in BugSplat and our documentation are in U.S. Dollars (USD).&#x20;

#### What payment methods are supported?

We support payments by all major credit cards and bank transfers. For Enterprise Plans, users are free to pay by check.

#### I'm part of a non-profit or charitable cause. Is there a discount?

BugSplat provides discounted and free plans for non-profit and charitable causes. It's our way of supporting the community and giving back to people doing great things online. If you think you qualify, please see our docs.

#### Can I collect more crashes or errors than are listed above?

Yes, our Enterprise plan can cover any level of crash or error volume you need. Please get in touch with [sales@bugsplat.com](https://mailtio:sales@bugsplat.com) to learn more.

#### What is an 'App'?

Both the Team and Business plans come with a specific amount of 'apps' included in their plans.  'Apps' are how BugSplat organizes crash and error reports to keep them organized and easy to navigate for the team's working on them. &#x20;

For example, the Team plan comes with two 'apps' because it is best practice to keep back-end and client reports from a single Application separate.  The Business plan comes with three 'apps' to provide for further organization and customization. &#x20;

Both plans allow teams to add more 'apps' to their plans in order to accommodate further customization and the addition of other products and applications your team might be supporting.

#### Can I manage more than one project, application, or game with my plan?

Yes, each plan comes with a standard number of "apps" that allow you to easily organize and handle multiple projects. All paid plans come with at least 2 "apps", allowing you to separate backend and client-side crashes and errors into separate buckets. Want to add more projects or more finely separate crashes? It's easy to upgrade your plan to include more "Apps".

#### Can I add more users to my account?

Yup! Both the Team and Business plans allow you to add additional users whenever you want.

#### Do I have to process all my crashes and errors, or can I process some fraction of them?

Users on the Business and Enterprise plan have the option to process a percentage of their crash volume using the [High Volume Fractional Crash Processing](what-is-high-volume-fractional-crash-processing.md) tool.&#x20;

#### What happens when I post more crashes or errors than are in my plan?

By default, BugSplat collects all crashes and errors submitted from an application. When a plan's level is exceeded, upgrading to a larger plan could be advisable.

For **Business plans**, BugSplat can distribute a collection of crashes over high volume times to collect crash data more economically via a Fractional Crash Collection process.

For **Team plans**, crashes are rejected once an account surpasses 100,000 crashes or errors per month. If those additional crashes are critical, users can upgrade at any point to the Business plan and continue tracking those crashes.
