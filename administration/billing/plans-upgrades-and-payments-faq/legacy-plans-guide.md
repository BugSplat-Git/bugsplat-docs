# Update to Our Legacy Plans Guide

On March 15th, 2022, BugSplat introduced a new pricing structure aimed at better serving our diverse user base and incorporating the latest advancements in our services. If you signed up for a BugSplat plan with a credit card before this date and have not yet transitioned to one of our updated plans, you're likely currently classified as a Legacy Plan customer. To ease the transition and express our gratitude for your continued loyalty, we've maintained your access to all features and unlimited upload storage space without transitioning you to the new pricing models that might include certain limitations.

**Why Changes Are Necessary Now**

As we continue to grow and improve BugSplat, maintaining these legacy plans has become increasingly challenging while delivering less and less value to the users who have them. The gap between the features and pricing models of our legacy plans and our current offerings has widened significantly. To better serve all our customers with the latest features and a more understandable pricing structure, we've reached a point where transitioning away from legacy plans is necessary.

**Benefits of Transitioning**

Transitioning to our updated plans isn't just about simplifying our internal systems—it's about providing you with better service. Here’s what you can expect:

* **More Monthly Crashes:** You'll likely find that the newer plans offer more monthly crash allowances, fitting the growing needs of modern software projects.
* **Enhanced Tools:** With updates to our platform, you'll get better tools for managing upload sizes, ensuring that you can focus more on what matters—building great software.
* **Continued High-Level Support:** As always, you'll receive the same high standard of crash analysis and support that you've come to expect from BugSplat.

**Special Offer for Our Legacy Plan Holders**

We understand that change can be daunting, but we're here to make this transition as beneficial for you as possible. As a token of our appreciation for your continued loyalty, we're offering a **25% discount off your plan for the next 3 months**. Simply reach out to us, and we'll apply this to your account as you transition from your legacy plan.
