# Updates to BugSplat Pricing Plans - March 2024

Greetings, BugSplat Community!  We’re rolling out some significant changes to our pricing plans aimed at making BugSplat’s crash reporting service even more accessible and aligned with your needs. Our updates are designed to simplify the selection process, ensure you’re getting incredible value, and directly address the feedback we’ve received from our dedicated user base.

**What’s New**

1. **Enhanced Free Plan**: Our Solo plan has been upgraded to the **Free Plan**, now with three user logins instead of just one. This enhancement is our way of bolstering support for small projects and developers at the outset of their journey with comprehensive crash reporting tools at no cost.
2. **Refined Team and Business Plans**: The Team and Business Plans remain but with modifications for better suitability across a wider range of project sizes. Expect more adaptability to support your project’s growth with these plans.
3. **Farewell to 'Apps'**: We’ve eliminated the 'apps' categorization in favor of offering you more freedom in how you organize your BugSplat usage, allowing for a more intuitive and less restrictive account management experience.
4. **Welcome User Groups**: Replacing 'apps', **User Groups** introduce a new level of organization within your BugSplat account, giving you the ability to set access and permissions that mirror the structure of your teams and projects for improved crash report management.
5. **Greater Storage Control**: With the introduction of enhanced control over your storage limits and our new **Usage Page**, monitoring your account's activity, including storage usage and crash volumes, is now simpler and more transparent.
6. **Reflecting Our Latest Features in Pricing**: The updated pricing structure incorporates our latest features, such as SSO, MFA enforcement, an expanded alerting suite, and additional integrations, offering a more robust crash reporting experience.
7. **Simplified Pricing Structure**: Our reworked pricing aims to make it easier for you to directly benefit from what you use the most, like monthly crashes and errors, upload storage, and advanced features, ensuring you only pay for what adds value to your projects.
