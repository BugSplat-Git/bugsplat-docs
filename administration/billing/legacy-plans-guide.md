# Legacy Plans Guide

{% hint style="info" %}
The information found in this document pertains only to BugSplat users who signed up for paid plans before March 15th, 2022.
{% endhint %}

Beginning March 15th, 2022 BugSplat instituted a new pricing structure which can be viewed on our [Plans](https://www.bugsplat.com/plans) page. &#x20;

If you are on a legacy plan you are grandfathered into that plan and no action is required on your end.

If you would like to speak directly with someone about your legacy account, or about our expanded pricing options now available, please send a note to [sales@bugsplat.com](mailto:sales@bugsplat.com).

### I'm on a Legacy plan, will I need to upgrade to the new pricing model?

Users who signed up before March 15th, 2022 are grandfathered into their current plan are not required to upgrade to the new billing structure.

### Upgrading Legacy Pricing Plans

BugSplat Legacy plans provided a variety of monthly pricing options for users which you can see below.

These plans can be paid for monthly with a credit card, or they can be paid for annually via an invoice (saving 5%).

These plans are no longer available for purchase starting March 15th, 2022.  However, if your account is currently governed by a Legacy plan because you signed up for a paid account before March 2022,  please email [sales](mailto:sales@bugsplat.com) for any assistance you might need.  You still qualify for these plans.

| Annual Crash Volume | Monthly Cost | Annual Cost (Save 5%) | Users     | Full-feature |
| ------------------- | ------------ | --------------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| 15,000              | $0           | $0                    | 1         | No           |
| 25,000              | $49          | $44                   | 3         | No           |
| 50,000              | $139         | $125                  | 10        | No           |
| 125,000             | $259         | $233                  | 20        | Yes          |
| 250,000             | $529         | $502                  | 40        | Yes          |
| Enterprise          | Volume Based | -                     | Unlimited |              |

### Automated Upgrades for Legacy plans

If your account has exceeded its plan limits - users or annual allotted crash volume - then you will be automatically upgraded to a plan which covers your usage.

To qualify for an upgrade an account has to exceed both the monthly and annual crash limit in the same month.

When this happens, the account admin (change admin email instructions [here](../introduction/user-permissions.md)) will get an email letting you know that your plan has changed. The [Billing](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/settings/company/billing) page and your next invoice will both reflect this upgrade.

You will have 30 days before your account is charged for the larger plan, which gives your team a window to get back into compliance and set your account back to its original setting (which can be accomplished on the [Account](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/account) page).

You can see your usage on the [Billing](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/settings/company/billing) page in Settings. If anything is in 'red' then it means that you're over your limit.

![Company Plan Usage](../../.gitbook/assets/company-plan-usage.png)

Have users that don't need access any longer? Delete them! Don't use an old database anymore - feel free to [retire it](../../introduction/production/managing-versions.md).

If you believe you shouldn't have been upgraded please view our [Fair-Refund](refund-policy.md) policy and then [contact us.](mailto:sales@bugsplat.com)

If you think that you need to upgrade to an Enterprise plan [send us a note](mailto:sales@bugsplat.com).
