# 30-day Trial

Just [sign up](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/sign-up) for an account and start using BugSplat as a regular user.

For the first 30-days you’ll have full access to BugSplat’s crash reporting tool. No credit card is required to sign up for an account.

When the 30-day trial expires, you’ll be asked to upgrade to a [paid plan](https://www.bugsplat.com/plans).

If you plan on using BugSplat’s [free tier](../free-plans-from-bugsplat/) of service, you’ll be automatically placed in it after the trial ends. The free tier plan comes with some service and total yearly crash report limits.
