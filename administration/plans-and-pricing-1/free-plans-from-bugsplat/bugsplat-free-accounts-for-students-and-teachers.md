# Education

### Overview

We're committed to supporting those who are giving back, working hard to learn, or hacking together something fun.

Because of that, BugSplat has an extended free tier plan for students and educators.

### Here are the rules:

If you're a student or educator who wants to use BugSplat for educational or instructional purposes, you probably qualify for our extended free tier plan.

For users and teams that qualify, you'll get annual 50,000 free annual crashes plus integrations with defect trackers.

If you're wondering if you qualify but are not sure, please send an email to our product manager Joey \(joey@bugsplat.com\) and tell him a little bit about yourself and your use case.

#### How long does this plan last?

This plan lasts as long as you use BugSplat for educational - as opposed to commercial - ends.

#### How can I support BugSplat during the free plan?

First off, it's very nice that you're thinking of us - we're touched.  

There is absolutely no responsibility on your part to help us in exchange for getting free crash reporting.  

If you're determined to be super nice - how dare you - you could mention us positively to your friends, coworkers, and fellow students & teachers.  Please also consider including a link to our website in your documentation, online material, or as a reference in a project, paper, or blog post.

BugSplat is a [bootstrapped startup](https://www.bugsplat.com/about/) and we grow largely on the back of positive word of mouth from our users.
