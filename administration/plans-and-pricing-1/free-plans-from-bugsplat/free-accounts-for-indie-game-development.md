# Indie Game Development

### Overview

We're committed to supporting those who are giving back, working hard to learn, or hacking together something fun.

Because of that, BugSplat has an extended free tier plan for those working on building an indie video game on little or no budget.

### Here are the rules:

If you're unaffiliated with a funded studio and currently developing your game you probably qualify for our extended free tier plan.

For users and teams that qualify, you'll get annual 50,000 free annual crashes plus integrations with defect trackers.

If you're wondering if you qualify but not sure, please send an email to our product manager Joey \(joey@bugsplat.com\) and tell him a little bit about yourself and your game.

#### How long does this plan last?

Once you launch your game or secure funding we will work with you to find a plan that works for your game, team, and company.

#### How can I support BugSplat during the free plan?

First off, it's very nice that you're thinking of us - we're touched.  

There is absolutely no responsibility on your part to help us in exchange for getting free crash reporting.  

If you're determined to be super nice - how dare you - you could mention us positively to your friends and coworkers.  Please also consider including a link to our website in your documentation.

BugSplat is a [bootstrapped startup](https://www.bugsplat.com/about/) and we grow largely on the back of positive word of mouth from our users.
