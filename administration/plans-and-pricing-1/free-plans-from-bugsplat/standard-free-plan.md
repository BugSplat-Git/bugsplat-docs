# Standard Free Plan

BugSplat wants to help all hackers, do-it-yourselfers, and those just getting started have access to world-class crash reporting.  Because of that, we provide a Free plan which covers 1 user, 1 database, up to 2,000 annual crashes, and all of the features of a paid account.  

#### How long does the free plan last?

The Free Plan is free forever.  If you need more users, databases, or crashes then you might consider upgrading to a paid plan.

#### Are there other free plans? 

Yup!  If you're an [indie game dev](free-accounts-for-indie-game-development.md), [working in education](bugsplat-free-accounts-for-students-and-teachers.md), supporting a not-for-profit [open source project](bugsplat-free-accounts-for-not-for-profit-open-source-projects.md), or working on a [good cause](good-causes.md), we've got some free plans for you to check out.

### How to get started

To get started with the Free plan follow the below steps: 

1. Sign up for an account [here](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/sign-up)
2. Follow the [Gettings Started](../../../introduction/getting-started/) docs to set up your account
3. Use BugSplat normally and stay within the guidelines of the plan \(1 user, 1 database, and less than 2,000 annual crashes\)
