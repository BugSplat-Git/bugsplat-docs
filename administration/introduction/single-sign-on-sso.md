# Single Sign-On (SSO)

Enhance your organization's security and user management capabilities with our Single Sign-On (SSO) support. By integrating with third-party identity providers via SAML and OpenID Connect protocols, we provide a robust and secure authentication mechanism, tailored especially for larger enterprises.

SSO not only centralizes user management but also fortifies security by reducing the number of attack vectors and potential password vulnerabilities. As organizations scale, implementing a unified and secure login process becomes paramount.

In addition to SSO, we also support GitHub sign-in. This feature is available on all plans and is controlled by individual users. Organizations cannot use it to centralize user management.  Learn more [here](password-settings-and-reset-options/).

If you wish to delve deeper into the technical intricacies or explore the potential security benefits for your organization, we'd be eager to connect. Please reach out to us at [support@bugsplat.com](mailto:support@bugsplat.com).
