# Single Sign-On (SSO)

With our SSO support, your team can log into BugSplat using a third-party identity provider. SSO is beneficial for larger organizations because it centralizes user management. Please contact [support@bugsplat.com](mailto:support@bugsplat.com) to learn more about SSO for your organization.

In addition to SSO, we also support GitHub sign-in. This feature is available on all plans and is controlled by individual users. Organizations cannot use it to centralize user management.
