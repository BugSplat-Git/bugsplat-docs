# Enforce MFA

BugSplat supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), enhancing security by requiring additional verification during the login process. This feature is currently available for individual users to enable at their discretion.

We are excited to announce the upcoming feature: MFA enforcement at the company level. This advancement will allow administrators to mandate MFA for all users within their organization, further strengthening account security across the company.

Stay tuned for updates regarding the rollout of this feature. If you're interested in learning more or have any queries, please contact us at [support@bugsplat.com](mailto:support@bugsplat.com).
