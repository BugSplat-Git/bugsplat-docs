# User Permissions

BugSplat provides the ability for Business plan level account holders to restrict access of select team members.  This creates two levels of users Restricted and Non-Restricted.  Non-Restricted users act as admins of the account and have the ability to view and change [Billing](../billing/) and [Account](../account-managment/) details.

There are lots of reasons you may want to restrict some of the users with access to your BugSplat account. Large Teams sometimes find that only a small part of their team needs unrestricted access to the BugSplat account. Similarly, if you work with a lot of consultants or contractors, you may want to limit the scope of their abilities inside of the app.

Luckily, restricting Users is simple and can be done by any Unrestricted users via the [Users](https://app.bugsplat.com/v2/users) page.

A user with 'Restricted' privileges will no longer be able to make changes to databases, update options, change pricing plans, or add users other users.
